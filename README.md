# MyGIT
I could not find a GIT SVC system for ChromeOS, so I built this


```
# Commands for this Sript

# changing the source folder
-changeSource <Path>

# making the Destination folder
-makeDest <Path>

# making a new branch
-branch <name>

# go back to an old branch
-revert <branch name>

# pull a list of all branches
-pullBranches

# list the current 'Source' & 'Destination' Paths
-list
```
